title: maven-agf-plugin - Changelog link corrected when release after a patch
tags: [framework-1-180,maven-codjo-plugin]
---
<u>Context</u>:
During the release of the framework, the update of the confluence framework home page confluence was not correct.

<u>Description</u>:
When the previous framework release was a patch (ends with .1 or .2...), the new changelog link was keeping the patch version (but with the new release version).
It has been fixed.
