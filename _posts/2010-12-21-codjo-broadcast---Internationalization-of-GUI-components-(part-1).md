title: agf-broadcast - Internationalization of GUI components (part 1)
tags: [framework-1-179,codjo-broadcast]
---
<u>Context</u>
Applications need to be internationalized. Therefore, all framework libraries that expose GUI components or contain messages dedicated to the user have to be internationalized too.

<u>Description</u>
Some GUI components have been internationalized as a proof of concept. All components will be internationalized in future releases.
There is no need to add the ```InternationalizationGuiPlugin``` upon applications to make them work.
