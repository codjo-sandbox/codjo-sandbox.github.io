<u>Context</u>
In order to check the Java virtual machine's patch on the server, we would like to be able to access the complete environment settings and system properties from the client's administration window.

<u>Description</u>
In a first version, environment settings and system properties were available in the log viewer. Now a new tab is dedicated to show them.
