<u>Context</u>
ROSES needs an auto-complete textfield that displays labels to users but transmits code to the server.

<u>Description</u>
A ```GuiWrapper``` has been added for the ```RequestTextFieldAutoCompleter``` component. It allows to handle automatically interactions between values loaded in ```DataSource``` classes and the graphical component.
