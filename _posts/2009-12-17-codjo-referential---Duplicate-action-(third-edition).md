<u>Context</u>:
Recently, the ```DuplicateAction``` was moved to the right of ```AddACtion``` in the ```requestToolBar```. Due to this modification it wasn't visible in the popup menu.
(See : [[framework:/2009/12/08/codjo-referential - Enhancement of the duplicate button's position in the toolbar]])

<u>Description</u>:
```AddAction``` isn't in the popup menu, so ```DuplicateAction``` is now added to the left of ```RemoveAction```
